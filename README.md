# Do You Know About Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C

## Purpose of "Do You Know About Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C ?"
This book asks a singular question. The response are then compiled into a print on demand book with an ISBN number.

The key idea is that Intravenous Vitamin C has been around for decades, yet health professsionals seem ignorant of its efficacy in the treatment of a wide range of toxin, bacterial and viral ailments

It is key we have a valid ISBN, as the publication is then included in the archives of the British Library.

Why is inclusion into the archives important? The internet is prone to corporate (technocratic) and state censoreship. An offline, paper based copy of the recorded responses to our singular question for the historical record is important.
